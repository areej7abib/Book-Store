# BookStore Web Application
Technologies Used:

-ASP.NET Core MVC for creating the structure and implementing the core application logic.

-Entity Framework Core to manage the database operations and handle data persistence.

-SQL Server as the relational database for storing books, categories, and user information.

-Bootstrap to ensure the design is clean, modern, and mobile-friendly.

-LINQ for efficient querying of the database.

-Identity Framework for handling user authentication and role-based authorization.

-N-tier Architecture to ensure separation of concerns and better organization by splitting the application into different layers (UI, business logic, data access).

-Stripe API integration to handle payment processing, allowing users to make secure purchases in the BookStore.

-Dependency Injection to keep the application scalable and maintainable.

-Repository Pattern to encapsulate data access logic and promote separation of concerns.
